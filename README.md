Virtuell Kock - Virtual Chef

Overview

Virtuell Kock is a web application designed to assist users in discovering new recipes based on ingredients they have. With a simple and user-friendly interface, users can input a query like "fish with potatoes" to search for relevant recipes. The app fetches data from the Spoonacular API to provide recipe recommendations, complete with images, instructions, and summaries.

This project is part of my ongoing journey as a frontend developer. It serves as a practical learning tool to enhance my understanding of JavaScript and APIs, while improving my ability to work with web technologies.

Functionality

Search for Recipes: Users can input ingredients in a text area and receive a list of recipes fetched from the Spoonacular API.
Recipe Details: When a user clicks on a recipe, they are taken to a detailed view showing the recipe's full instructions and image.
Go Back Button: A 'Go Back' button allows users to return to the previous page or list of recipes after viewing a detailed recipe.
Responsive Design: The layout is designed to be simple and clean, with a modern touch for a better user experience.
Technologies Used

HTML5
CSS3 (for styling and layout)
JavaScript (for functionality, including event handling and DOM manipulation)
Spoonacular API (for fetching recipe data)
Learning Goals

This project is a part of my studies as a frontend developer. Through this project, I aim to:

Strengthen my understanding of JavaScript and improve my coding skills.
Learn how to work with APIs to fetch and display data dynamically.
Practice web design and ensure that the project is responsive and user-friendly.
Develop skills in using localStorage for saving data locally on the client-side.
Future Plans

In the future, I plan to expand this project by adding more advanced features like:

Implementing filtering options for dietary restrictions (e.g., vegan, gluten-free).
Allowing users to save their favorite recipes to their profile.
Adding search history for users to revisit previous searches.
